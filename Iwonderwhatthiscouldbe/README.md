# I Wonderrr — Interactive Valentine Letter

This is a small HTML/CSS/JS project meant to be published as a simple GitHub Pages website.

How to publish

- Create a new repository on GitHub and push this folder as the repository root (or upload the files).
- In the repository Settings -> Pages, select the branch (`main` or `master`) and root folder `/` to publish.

Notes before publishing

- Ensure all image assets referenced in `index.html` and `script.js` (e.g. `envelope.png`, `heart-bg.jpg`, `window.png`, `heart.gif`, `yes.png`, `no.png`, `Cane.png`) are included in the repository and that filenames match their case exactly — GitHub Pages is case-sensitive.
- You can preview locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.

Files of interest

- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — interactive behaviors

If you want, I can also add a small GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy to `gh-pages` branch.
